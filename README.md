# hello-world
Hello! I'm @erycas
I'm slowly becoming more interested in programming. I am also a huge fan of volleyball.
I'm currently learning Java. I've dabbled in Python and plan to learn more in the future.
My pronouns are she/they (Generally, any pronoun other than he/him is okay with me ðŸ˜Š)
Thanks for stopping by! (^^ã‚ž
